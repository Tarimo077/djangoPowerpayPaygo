<h3 style='text-align:center;'><b>9.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b></h3> 

    9.1.  Use of Intellectual Property and Proprietary Notices. During the term of this Agreement, either party may use the other party's trademarks in their advertising and promotional media; provided that the party using such marks conspicuously indicates in each such medium that such trademarks are Trademarks of the owner of such mark and such use inures to the benefit of the owner of such mark. For example, Customer will ensure that all Customer products incorporating the Software as a Service that are in Customer's possession or control incorporate copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices in the same manner that POWERPAY incorporates such notices for the Software as a Service, or in any manner reasonably requested by POWERPAY. Nothing herein will grant to Customer any right, title or interest in the POWERPAY Trademarks, Deliverables, or other POWERPAY property unless so indicated herein. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, each party will immediately cease all use of the other party's intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, whether issued or pending.<br><br>

    9.2.   Intellectual Property Liability Limitation. POWERPAY shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on or to the extent arising from: (1) use of an outdated or unaltered release of any Hardware and software as a Service if such infringement would have been avoided by use of updated and amended Software as a Service which had been offered to Customer; (2) the combination or use of the Software as a Service with hardware or software not furnished or approved in writing by POWERPAY (for example, use in violation of Authorized Use, Authorized Sites, Authorized Platforms); or (3) the use of any Software as a Service that has been modified or altered other than by POWERPAY or with POWERPAY's prior written permission but only to the extent that the unmodified version of the Software as a Service would not have infringed.  POWERPAY is not responsible for any problems of any nature arising from the use of  IoT Hardware and Software as a Service for purposes for which it was not deaccepted, (the purposes for which it was deaccepted being those clearly apparent from the Documentation and related materials). Either Party's total liability under or in connection with this Agreement whether for breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability in tort or otherwise will not in aggregate exceed the total amount of the Subscription Fee(s) paid by Customer to POWERPAY under this Agreement.<br>

<h3 style='text-align:center;'><b>10.INDEMNITY</b></h3>
      
    10.1.   Infringement Indemnity.

If use of the Software as a Service is permanently enjoined for any reason, POWERPAY, at POWERPAY's option, and in its sole discretion, may: (a) modify the Software as a Service so as to avoid infringement; (b) procure the right for Customer to continue to use and reproduce the Software as a Service and Documentation; or (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer Subscription Fees paid.  POWERPAY shall have no obligation under this Section 8.1 for or with respect to, and Customer indemnifies, defends, and holds POWERPAY harmless from and against all claims, actions, or demands alleging infringement that arise as a result of (a) the combination of non-infringing items supplied by POWERPAY with any items not supplied by POWERPAY; (b) modification of the Software as a Service or Documentation by Customer or by POWERPAY in compliance with Customer's designs, specifications, or instructions; (c) the direct or contributory infringement of any process patent by Customer through the use of the Software as a Service; (d) continued use by Customer of other than the latest release of the Software as a Service or continued allegedly infringing activity by Customer after Customer has been notified of the possible infringement; (e) any modification or derivative work made by POWERPAY based on Customer's instructions; and, (e) abuse, misuse, neglect or use of Software as a Service not authorized by this Agreement.  POWERPAY's Subscription Fee(s) and POWERPAY's other charges to Customer under this Agreement as well as Customer's liability are determined on the basis of the following limitations and exclusions of liability. Both parties expressly agree that these limitations are reasonable because of (inter alia) the likelihood that the quantum of damages awardable to one party for a breach by the other party of this Agreement would be disproportionately greater than the value of this Agreement to either party.<br><br> 

    10.2.  Other Indemnity. Customer is responsible and indemnifies and holds POWERPAY harmless for any and all losses, liability, or damages arising out of, or incurred in connection with, Customer's use or reproduction of the Deliverables, including Software as a Service, pursuant to this Agreement.<br><br>

    10.3.  Condition to Indemnification.

POWERPAY will control the defense and settlement of any claim under Section 8.1 and Customer will control the defense and settlement of any claim under Section 8.2. The indemnified party agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and provide reasonable assistance in the defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnifying party is not responsible for any costs incurred or compromise made by the indemnified party unless the indemnifying party has given prior written consent to the cost or compromise.<br> 

<h3 style='text-align:center;'><b>11. CONFIDENTIALITY</b></h3>

    11.1.  Confidentiality.

    11.2.  Limitations on Confidentiality Restrictions. Section 9.1 does not apply to any information that: (a) is already lawfully in the receiving party's possession (unless received pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement); (b) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of the receiving party; (c) is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party who may transfer or disclose such information without restriction; (d) is required to be disclosed by the receiving party as a matter of law (provided that the receiving party will use all reasonable efforts to provide the disclosing party with prior notice of such disclosure and to obtain a protective order therefor); (e) is disclosed by the receiving party with the disclosing party's approval; and (f) is demonstrably and independently developed by the receiving party without any use of confidential information. In all cases, the receiving party will use all reasonable efforts to give the disclosing party ten (10) days' prior written notice of any disclosure of information under this agreement.
